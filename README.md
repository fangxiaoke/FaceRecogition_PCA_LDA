This repos tends to handle photo-sketch recognition task using sketch matching method. I use two datasets: CUHK and CUFSF.

Face features are extracted from VGG-Face model (4096-dimension), which are stored as .mat files.

The GUI system for photo-retrieval is in the SearchGUI directory based on the extracted face features using PCA and LDA algorithm.

Final recognition rate is about 87%. Continue to be improved...
